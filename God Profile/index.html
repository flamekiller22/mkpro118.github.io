                        The Temple of <span class="character">Apollo</span> at <span class="place">Delphi</span> is an ancient Greek temple dedicated to the god <span class="character">Apollo</span>. It is located on the slopes of <span class="place">Mount Parnassos</span> in <span class="place">Delphi</span>, Greece and is considered one of the most important religious sites in ancient Greece. The temple was a major center for the worship of <span class="character">Apollo</span>, as well as a center for the Pythian Games, which was a musical and athletic competition that were held every four years.

                    <div class="text">
                        According to ancient Greek mythology, it was believed that the god <span class="character">Zeus</span> released two eagles, one to the east and one to the west, and the point at which they met marked the center of the world. This spot was identified as <span class="place">Delphi</span> and a sanctuary was built there in honor of <span class="character">Apollo</span>. The original temple at <span class="place">Delphi</span> was believed to have been built in the 7th century BCE and was eventually replaced by a larger temple in the 4th century BCE.

                        The Pythian Games were a quadrennial athletic and musical competition held in Ancient Greece in honor of Apollo, the god of music, poetry, prophecy, and healing. The games were held at Delphi, on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, near the famous Temple of Apollo at Delphi, where the Pythian Oracle was located.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        The games were first held in the late 7th century BCE, when the temple of Apollo at Delphi was founded and continued until the 4th century CE. The Pythian Games were one of the four major Panhellenic Games, along with the Olympic, Isthmian, and Nemean Games, and were considered to be one of the most important cultural events in ancient Greece. They consisted of athletic events, such as foot races, wrestling, and chariot races, as well as musical and poetic competitions.
